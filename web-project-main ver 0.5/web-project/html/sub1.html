            <br><br>
            <p>
                Go contains a small number of popular concepts inspired by 
                other languages, designed to create the simplest possible 
                code. This saves time scanning code to check it, as well 
                as time saved writing less code.
                <br><br>
                For example, Go has very few data types, such as : 
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>int</li> 
                    <li>string</li>
                    <li>bool</li>
                    <li>float64</li>
                    <li>complex128</li>
                </ul> 
                <br>
            <p>
                and each has default options 
                that cover most uses. With such few options and concepts 
                to learn, experienced programmers can learn Go in just a few days.

            <h1>2.Go is Fast</h1>

            <p>

                Go code is compiled and directly translated into processor-understandable
                 formats. This makes it far faster than languages like Java that first 
                 need to compile into byte code, before executing it via a virtual 
                 machine (VM).
                 <br><br>
                 Boasting small application sizes, Go binary files can be up to 10x 
                 smaller than their Java equivalent. This is especially notable for
                 large applications deployed on multiple servers, heavily reducing 
                 file loading time and making for much-improved performance.
                 <br><br>
                 Go programs are lightweight, as Go runtimes clean up unused memory 
                 as extra code within the executable binary. This makes it easier 
                 to write memory-efficient Go code as the Go compiler has some spare 
                 code logic within each program.
                 <br><br>
                 Languages like Rust and C++ use slightly less memory than Go, however,
                  this is because they afford developers more control over memory usage, 
                  whereas Go runtime automatically handles this for efficiency.

            <h1>3.ideal for large-scale projects</h1>

            <p>Many languages designed prior to the adoption of multi-core processors 
             (such as Java, JavaScript, C++ and Python) have difficulties scaling and
             are one-threaded. As a more modern language designed for multi-core processors,
             Go contains effective support for parallel processes (as do C#, Erlang and other languages).
             It’s also designed in the internet age, so Go doesn’t require third-party libraries for web 
             service support.
             <br><br>
             Goroutines are scalable and non-blocking, ideal for when multiple concurrent processes are
             required — and take up just 2kb of overhead memory. Goroutines are a convenient combination
             of Javascript’s async features with standard Java multi-threading. As a result, open-source 
             projects like Kubernetes, Docker, InfluxDB and Jaeger all opted for Go as their programming language.
             <br><br>
             Golang’s quick and efficient compilation makes it effective for even the largest projects. Even the 
             most complex projects can be quickly built and worked on efficiently to reduce bugs and aid easy debugging.
             <br><br>
             On large projects where many developers work together to maintain and develop in teams, it’s integral that
             they be able to work in sync and understand each other’s solutions. Go is designed based on the philosophy
             that there should be very few solutions (ideally just one) rather than a wide variety of ambiguous solutions
             so that maintaining these large and complex projects is as simple as possible.
