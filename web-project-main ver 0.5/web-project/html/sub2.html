        <p>Popular open-source tools like Kubernetes, Docker and
         Prometheus are written in Go for container deployment, 
         scaling and management for running and bundling applications.

        <p>Cloud service tools like Terraform and OpenShift are written

         with OpenShift running on top of Kubernetes and used by 
         companies such as KPMG to automate and enhance their AI 
         workflows.

            For server-side operations, Netflix uses Go for some of
           its server architecture, writing its Rend proxy on Go. 
           Netflix said: 
           “The decision to use Go was deliberate, because we needed 
           something that had lower latency than Java (where garbage 
           collection pauses are an issue) and is more productive for
            developers than C, while also handling tens of thousands of
             client connections. Go fits this space well.”

        <p>Dropbox also switched from Python to Go in 2014 for performance-critical
        backend features.

            Large web apps like Monzo’s online banking app have been built in Go since
            their inception, and now use it to host over 1,600 microservices. Monzo 
            has been using Go solely since 2015, working with Kubernetes and
            highlighting that Go is “quite simple, it’s statically typed, and 
            it makes it easy for us to get people on board.”

            SoundCloud have also been using Go since as early as 2012 in their build
            and deployment system, though they mostly use Ruby on Rails. SoundCloud
            developed what eventually became Prometheus in 2012, which is now used
            by AT&T, Honeywell, JP Morgan & Chase, and many other large companies.

            Our boot.dev web app, designed to teach you computer science interactively,
            is also written in Go.

            Other large companies that use Go include Google & YouTube (obviously), 
            Medium, BBC, Dailymotion, SendGrid, and Badoo.

        <h1>3.Machine learning and data science</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Both Go and Python have been considered some of the best programming languages
             for AI and machine learning, yet Go trails way behind R and Python as the
              most popular data science and machine learning languages.  
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Go can handle complex math problems much faster than Python, though Python
            has advantages with its versatility, readability and multi-purpose use 
            for data science. You can now run Tensorflow models in Go as opposed 
            to just Python to take advantage of some of Go’s speed advantages. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            We believe that Go will become a much more widely adopted machine-learning
            language in the future.
