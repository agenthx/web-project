            <p>What is the Go or Golang programming language?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Go, also called Golang or Go language, is an Open Source
                 programming language that Google developed. Software 
                 developers use Go in an array of operating systems 
                 and frameworks to develop web applications, 
                 cloud and networking services, and other 
                 types of software.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Go is statically typed, explicit and modeled after 
                the C programming language. Because of Go language's 
                fast startup time, low runtime overhead and ability 
                to run without a virtual machine (VM), it has become 
                a very popular language for writing microservices 
                and other uses. In addition, Go is used for concurrent 
                programming -- a strategy to execute multiple tasks 
                at one time, out of order or in partial order.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Go language was inspired by the productivity and relative 
                simplicity of Python. It uses goroutines, or lightweight 
                processes, and a collection of packages for efficient 
                dependency management. It was designed to solve several 
                problems, including slow build time, uncontrolled 
                dependencies, effort duplication, difficulty writing 
                automatic tools and cross-language development.</p>
